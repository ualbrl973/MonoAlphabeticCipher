# MonoAlphabeticCipher

For using the application it is important to input the desired cipher text to descipher without special characters at the start such as "" --> "abcd" should be inputed as abcd, and without any line jumps.
It will descipher it correctly even if you input it like that but the result will look with miss aligned spaces making it hard to read.
