# MonoAlphabeticCipher

For using the application it is important to:
- Input the desired cipher text to descipher without special characters at the start or end such as "" --> "abcd" should be inputed as abcd.
- Shouldn't have any line jumps.
- Special characters in the middle of ciphertext are fine such as numbers or other simbols like / " '
- It can include dots even at the end.

If you input incorrectly, it will still descipher it correctly  but the result will look with miss aligned spaces making it hard to read.
